## Description

This is an Hotel Management App. It was made using jQuery and Javascript OOP (Object Oriented Programming) principles. It consists of four tabs, each displaying information about today's bookings, revenue or room service orders: 

1. The Main tab: displays information about the total numbers of rooms occupied, rooms available, occupancy rate and today's bookings and orders.
2. The Orders tab: displays detailed information about today's orders. There is an input that can be used to search for the orders for a different date. When a customer is selected, all the information in the tab will refer to that particular customer.
3. The Room tab: displays detailed information about today's bookings. There is an input that can be used to search for the bookings for a different date. When a customer is selected, all the information in the tab will refer to that particular customer.
4. The Customer tab: where a new customer can be added, or an existing customer can be searched for.

## Learning Goals

- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Separate business-logic code from view-related code
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
